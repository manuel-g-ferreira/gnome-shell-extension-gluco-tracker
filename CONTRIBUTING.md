# Contributing

We welcome your contributionsâ€”whether you're fixing bugs, implementing new features, or helping us maintain the project. Our goal is to make contributing to this project easy, transparent, and enjoyable.

## How We Work

### Communication
Before starting work on a significant change, please open an issue to discuss your idea with the repository maintainers. This helps ensure that your contribution aligns with our project goals.

### GitHub Workflow
1. **Fork the Repository:**
   Fork the repo and create your branch from the `main` branch.
2. **Development:**
    - Write your code and tests (our minimum requirement is support for GNOME Shell versions 45 and above).
    - Ensure any new or changed functionality is fully documented.
3. **Testing:**
   Verify that your changes work across existing features and that your code passes all linter checks.
4. **Pull Request:**
   Once your changes are ready, open a pull request with a clear description of your changes and the motivation behind them. We appreciate clear commit messages and pull request descriptions!

## Code Style & Quality
- Make sure your code lints and adheres to our style guidelines.
- Run tests to confirm that nothing breaks.
